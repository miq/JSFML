Intercom Headers
================
This directory contains the header files for the JSFML/SFML inter-communication classes. These are used to map simple SFML data structures to their respective Java counterparts and vice versa.

These headers and their respective sources need to be updated if changes are done on Java fields or methods that are marked as `@Intercom`.
